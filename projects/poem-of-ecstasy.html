  <p>
    The moment of encounter is suspended in liminal flux, between what we are ceasing to be and what we are in the process of becoming: a sovereign body, a body of fluid, a body enmeshed, a body in wreckage, an open wound, gently healing and regenerating. Existing between exquisite pain and constant dull ache, between agony and ecstasy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Poem of Ecstasy (Procession) is part of a project exploring themes of sadomasochism, catharsis and internal cosmology through architectures and psychoacoustics within experimental forms of field recording, vocals, audio signal processing and low frequency sound waves.
